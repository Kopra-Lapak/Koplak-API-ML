Steps to create a copra classification model:

1. **Import Required Libraries:**
Import the necessary libraries for the machine learning model.

2. **Define Dataset Paths for Each Directory (Train, Valid, Test):**
Specify the dataset paths for the training, validation, and testing directories.

3. **Determine the Number of Data for Each Directory:**
Identify the total number of data for each directory (train, valid, test).

4. **Display Labels in Each Directory:**
Show the labels present in each directory.

6. **Create a Class to Iterate Data Usage:**
If the dataset feels insufficient, create a class to iterate the use of data from the image dataset.

7. **Augment the Dataset:**
Before classifying using a machine learning model, augment the dataset, especially for training and validation data.

8. **Build a Classification Model:**
Define the architecture of the model. In this case, use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm.

9. **Compile the Model:**
Compile the model, specify the optimizer, loss function, and required metrics.

10. **Display Model Summary:**
Show the summary of the model architecture.

11. **Train the Model:**
Train the model by defining the steps per epoch and validation according to requirements for optimal results.

12. **Save Trained Model:**
Save the trained model in an h5 file for deployment purposes.

13. **Plot Accuracy Results:**
Map the accuracy results from the training and validation data to assess the classification model's performance.

14. **Test the Model:**
Test the model using the test data and observe the accuracy results.

15. **Validation using File Upload Method:**
To validate the model, use the `files.upload()` method to make predictions and check if the uploaded image file has been predicted correctly according to the expected label.
